2026-02-20 23:01:16,Bot,Hello! I'm ready to discuss EU security and Defense Policy. What's on your mind?
2026-02-20 23:01:59,User,I think the EU should NOT have a common army. What do you think?
2026-02-20 23:01:59,Bot,"Actually, a unified European army is the only way to achieve true strategic autonomy and stop wasting billions of euros on duplicated military structures across 27 different nations. By pooling our resources, we would finally become a credible global power capable of defending our interests without being entirely dependent on the United States."

2026-02-20 23:02:48,Bot,"Relying solely on NATO makes Europe vulnerable to the shifting political whims of the United States, which may not always prioritize European security. A common army ensures we can protect our own borders and interests independently, rather than being a mere auxiliary to American foreign policy."
