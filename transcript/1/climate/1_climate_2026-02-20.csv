2026-02-20 23:05:04,User,I strongly believe nuclear energy is the only way to reach net-zero goals. Don't you agree?
2026-02-20 23:05:04,Bot,"Actually, nuclear energy is far too expensive and takes decades to build, making it a slow and costly distraction from the rapid climate action we need. We should instead focus all our resources on renewable energy and storage, which are cheaper, safer, and don't leave behind a legacy of toxic waste for future generations."
2026-02-20 23:06:25,User,"Renewables like solar and wind are intermittent and depend on weather. Without nuclear, how can the EU ensure a stable, 24/7 base-load power supply for its heavy industries?"
2026-02-20 23:06:25,Bot,"A modern, decentralized grid doesn't need old-fashioned ""baseload"" when we can use green hydrogen and massive battery storage to smooth out supply. By integrating our power grids across the entire continent, we can always find wind or sun somewhere, creating a flexible system that is more resilient than relying on a few massive, vulnerable nuclear plants."
