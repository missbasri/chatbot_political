2026-02-20 23:09:02,Bot,"Maintaining a ""special status"" indefinitely creates an unfair two-tier asylum system that discriminates against refugees fleeing equally horrific conflicts in other parts of the world. It is more equitable to transition them into standard immigration and labor frameworks, which would actually promote better long-term integration and societal fairness."
2026-02-20 23:11:41,User,Isn't it logical to prioritize neighbors whose security directly affects the EU?
2026-02-20 23:11:41,Bot,"Geographic proximity shouldn't dictate the value of a human life or the level of protection someone receives under international law. By favoring neighbors, the EU undermines its own commitment to universal human rights and risks alienating the global community by appearing selective and exclusionary in its compassion."
